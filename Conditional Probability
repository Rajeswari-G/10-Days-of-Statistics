Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?



Probabilities = BB,BG,GB,GG
The order should matter to make it 1/2, rather than 1/3.

First is a boy. If order matters, then you can eliminate choices GG and GB from the matrix, thus giving you 1/2 probability.

If order doesn't matter (but we still know there is already at least 1 boy), then we still have 3 possibilities: BB, BG, GB.

Answer" 1/3
